# Idea: identify a mini universe of securities to contextualize
# target variable "regime".

# Make these mini universes dynamic by design as opposed to fixed
# Handles the idea of a regime shift naturally - as the fundamental
# characteristics of the universe deteriorates -> transitions into
# defining a new "optimal" universe for evaluation.

# Question is: what makes for an optimal universe? Features that combine
# within a system to supply high confidence mean reverting signals for
# a target variable.

# With the caveat being these systems are not easily redefined...
# but by nature, redefinable.
